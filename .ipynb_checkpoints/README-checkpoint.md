# NYC Noise Complaint Analysis

This project analyzes NYC 311 noise complaint data to identify spatial and temporal patterns. The goal is to help answer questions like:

- When do most noise complaints occur?
- Which boroughs and ZIP codes report the most noise?
- Are there seasonal or time-based trends?
- Can we forecast complaint volume over time? By season? By location?

I'm using Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, seaborn), SQL, and Jupyter Notebooks for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

Forecasting and modeling (Prophet, statsmodels) coming soon.
