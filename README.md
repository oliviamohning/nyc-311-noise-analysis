# NYC Noise Complaint Analysis

This project analyzes NYC 311 noise complaint data to identify spatial and temporal patterns. The goal is to help answer questions like:

- When do most noise complaints occur?
- Which boroughs report the most noise?
- Are there seasonal or time-based trends?
- Can we forecast complaint volume over time? By season? By location?

Tools used: Python (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`), SQL, and Jupyter Notebooks for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

Forecasting and modeling (e.g., `Prophet`, `statsmodels`) coming soon.

Dataset: 311_noise_complaints_sample_small.csv (included)
